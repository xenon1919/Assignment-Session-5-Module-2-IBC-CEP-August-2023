Write a Rust program that includes a generic HashMap struct and a trait that defines a method for sorting the elements in the map by their key values. Your program should include the following:

A generic HashMap struct that takes two type parameters and implements the SortByKey trait.

A trait called SortByKey that defines a method for sorting the elements in the map by their key values.

An implementation of the SortByKey trait for the HashMap struct. This implementation should sort the elements in the map by their key values in ascending order.

A main function that creates a new instance of your HashMap struct, adds several key-value pairs to it, and then sorts the elements in the map by their keys.
